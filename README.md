# Global-Superstore-Sales-Profit-Dashboard-for-Business-Insights
This project focuses on designing an end-to-end business intelligence dashboard using Python for data cleaning and exploratory analysis and Power BI for interactive visualization.The dataset represents a global retail store’s transactional sales data, including information about customers, products, regions, order dates, and shipping details.   

The goal was to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total profit, and order volume, while also understanding category-wise and regional performance. Trend analysis was carried out to observe sales fluctuations over months and years. The dashboard also enables business stakeholders to explore relationships between discount levels and profit margins, helping to optimize pricing strategies and regional sales targets.

###   Tools & Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn): Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Power BI: Dashboard design and interactive visualization

Dataset: Superstore Dataset (Kaggle)

File Used: Cleaned_Superstore.csv (pre-processed in Python for smooth Power BI loading)

 # Conclusion:
 The Global Superstore — Sales & Profit Dashboard successfully provides a clear and interactive overview of the company’s sales and profitability performance across various regions, categories, and time periods. By combining Python-based data cleaning and analysis with Power BI’s powerful visualization capabilities, this project transforms raw sales data into meaningful business insights.     
 

The dashboard enables management to monitor key performance indicators in real-time, identify high-performing product segments, and recognize underperforming regions or categories that require strategic attention. Additionally, the trend analysis and discount–profit relationship visualizations support more informed pricing and marketing decisions.     


Overall, this project demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can be effectively leveraged to drive smarter business decisions and enhance overall operational efficiency.
