# Global-Superstore-Sales-Profit-Dashboard-for-Business-Insights
This project focuses on designing an end-to-end business intelligence dashboard using Python for data cleaning and exploratory analysis and Power BI for interactive visualization.The dataset represents a global retail storeâ€™s transactional sales data, including information about customers, products, regions, order dates, and shipping details.
The goal was to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total profit, and order volume, while also understanding category-wise and regional performance. Trend analysis was carried out to observe sales fluctuations over months and years. The dashboard also enables business stakeholders to explore relationships between discount levels and profit margins, helping to optimize pricing strategies and regional sales targets.

###   Tools & Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn): Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Power BI: Dashboard design and interactive visualization

Dataset: Superstore Dataset (Kaggle)

File Used: Cleaned_Superstore.csv (pre-processed in Python for smooth Power BI loading)
